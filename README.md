# PanesManager Extension for StarUML 2

This extension for StarUML(http://staruml.io) adds two buttons in the statusbar of the interface (bottom bar) to toggle the Sidebar (left pane) and the Navigator (right pane) of the window.

## How it works

You just have to install the extension, and restart or reload (CMD + R) StarUML 2. You will see two new buttons in the right section of the Statusbar.

You should know you can perform the same operation with the `View > Hide Sidebar`and `View > Hide Navigator` menus.
